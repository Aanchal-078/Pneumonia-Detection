# Pneumonia-Detection
This project leverages ensemble learning to classify chest X-ray images as COVID, Pneumonia, or Normal. We use three pretrained models MobileNet, ResNet, and VGG16 to improve prediction accuracy. The system allows users to upload X-ray images and get a diagnosis, providing an efficient AI-powered solution for respiratory condition detection.
